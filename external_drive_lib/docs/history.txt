1.0.1a
added copy_sync/del_sync - not finished

1.0.1b
copy_sync seems to work - both to and from android to windows

1.0.1c
delete_sync / copy_sync work -> however, apparently sync operations win->android is slow (because of how we're testing to make sure it's good)

1.0.1d
bulk copy finally works

1.0.1e
look for "Copying#" (#32770) with child DirectUIHWND

1.0.1f
if autorefresh -> update android drives on add/delete; actually -> autorefresh all the time.
refresh() -> for android drives check "connected_via_usb", reuse what possible
use real unique_id + galaxy s6 is friendly name

1.0.1g
use [a0] for first android drive
[dX] for drive idx

1.0.1h
see if android_file.exists actually works /same for android_folder and  android_drive.connected

1.0.1i
android -> portable

1.0.1j
parse_file/folder_name -> parse_file/folder
